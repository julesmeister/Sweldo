- ✅ Zustand state management
- ✅ Web build process setup
- ✅ Firebase hosting configuration
- ✅ Firestore integration for web data storage (employees & payroll sync) implemented
- ✅ Login dialog supports both desktop and web modes with company selection
- ✅ EmployeeList supports both desktop and web modes, loads employees from Firestore/local DB and sorts by ID ascending
- ✅ HolidayCalendar and HolidaysPage support web mode with Firestore-based CRUD operations
- ✅ Dexie-based IndexedDB caching implemented for EmployeeList (Firestore employee queries)
- ✅ Toast notifications on cache reloads for EmployeeList, HolidaysPage, and HolidayCalendar
- ✅ Dexie-based IndexedDB caching implemented for Holidays and missingTime logs with toasts on reload
- ✅ Authentication session persistence in web mode via localStorage (fixed login state being lost on page refresh)
- ✅ Company name persistence in web mode via localStorage (fixed records not loading after page refresh)
- ✅ Enhanced company selection UI with dedicated flow for authenticated users
- ✅ Critical bug fix for login dialog not appearing when company selection needed
- ✅ Electron app structure is in place (`main`, `renderer` processes).
- ✅ Next.js is used for the renderer process, allowing for React-based UI.
- ✅ Basic navigation and layout components (`Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `RootLayout`) are functional.
- ✅ SQLite is used as the local database via `better-sqlite3`.
- ✅ Dexie.js is implemented for client-side caching, initially for `AppSettings` and `Roles` in Firestore, and `Holidays`.
- ✅ Zustand is used for state management (`authStore`, `settingsStore`, `employeeStore`, `loadingStore`, `dateSelectorStore`).
- ✅ Core models for Employee, Settings, Holiday, Cash Advance, Loan, Leave, Shorts, Role, Timesheet, Payroll, Statistics are defined.
- ✅ Firebase Authentication is integrated for web mode.
- ✅ Firestore is used as the backend for web mode, with models and services to interact with it (e.g., `settings_firestore.ts`, `role_firestore.ts`, `employee_firestore.ts`, `holiday_firestore.ts`, `statistics_firestore.ts`).
- ✅ Settings page (`settings.tsx`) allows viewing and some management of application settings, conditionally rendering for web/desktop.
- ✅ `RoleManagement.tsx` handles PIN authentication and role display, adapted for web mode.
- ✅ `ScheduleSettings.tsx` has been refactored to work in web mode.
- ✅ `CalendarDayCell.tsx` button styling is corrected.
- ✅ `StatisticsPage` (`statistics.tsx`) fetches data from Firestore in web mode and reacts to `DateSelector` changes.
- ✅ `HolidaysPage` (`holidays.tsx`) now correctly uses `useDateSelectorStore` to react to global date changes, fetching data from Firestore in web mode and local DB in desktop mode.
- ✅ `TimesheetService` is properly implemented to handle both web and desktop environments.
- ✅ `timesheet_test.tsx` correctly handles web mode by checking environment and using appropriate data sources.

## What's Left to Build / Improve

1.  **Full Web Mode Compatibility for all Pages:**
    *   **Timesheet Component Interface Updates**: The current timesheet component has TypeScript interface issues when adapting for web mode. The hooks and components expect non-nullable model instances, but those models aren't available or needed in web mode. The component interfaces need to be updated to support a nullable or alternative pattern for web mode.
    *   **Adapt Timesheet-Related Components**: Several timesheet-related components like `AttendanceHistoryDialog`, `useTimesheetEdit`, `useTimesheetCheckbox`, and `useTimesheetHistoryOperations` need to be updated to support web mode with Firestore-backed data access.
    *   **Cache, Error Handling and Loading States**: Add proper caching, error handling, and loading states for web mode data fetching to improve the user experience during network latency.
    *   Ensure all pages that currently rely on local DB (`dbPath`) are fully functional in web mode using Firestore (`companyName`).
    *   This includes: `PayrollPage`, `TimesheetPage`, potentially others.
    *   **Create a custom React hook (e.g., `useDateAwareDataFetching`)** to encapsulate the common logic of subscribing to `useDateSelectorStore` and triggering data re-fetching when the selected date changes. Refactor `cashAdvances.tsx`, `loans.tsx`, `leaves.tsx`, and `shorts.tsx` to use this hook and remove redundant date management logic.
2.  **Data Synchronization Strategy (Web & Desktop):**
    *   Define and implement a clear strategy for how data entered in web mode synchronizes with the local database if a user switches between modes (or vice-versa, though less common).
    *   Consider if two-way sync is needed or if one mode is primary.
3.  **Complete Firestore Models & Services:**
    *   Ensure all data models have corresponding Firestore save/load/update/delete functions (e.g., for `CashAdvance`, `Loan`, `Leave`, `Shorts`, `Payroll`, `Timesheet`).
4.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for models and services.
    *   Integration tests for UI components and data flow.
    *   End-to-end tests for key user workflows in both desktop and web mode.
5.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Consistent loading states and error handling across all pages.
    *   Improved visual feedback for user actions.
    *   Ensure all interactive elements are intuitive and accessible.
6.  **Offline Support for Web Mode (PWA features):**
    *   Investigate using service workers and caching to provide some level of offline functionality for the web version, if deemed necessary.
7.  **Data Migration & Backup (Desktop):**
    *   Ensure robust data migration for schema changes.
    *   Implement a user-friendly backup and restore mechanism for the local SQLite database.
8.  **Finalize Caching Strategy:**
    *   Review and extend Dexie.js caching to other relevant Firestore data (e.g., monthly schedules, payroll summaries) to improve performance and reduce Firestore reads.

## Current Status

*   The application is partially functional in both desktop (JSON files as Database) and web (Firestore) modes.
*   Focus is on achieving full feature parity and stability for web mode, particularly data fetching and state management tied to global date selection.
*   The timesheet components work in the test environment, but the full timesheet interface has TypeScript compatibility issues that need resolution.

## Known Issues

*   TypeScript errors in `renderer/pages/timesheet.tsx` when adapting for web mode - component interfaces expect non-nullable model instances that aren't available in web mode, or props are missing (`AttendanceHistoryDialog`).
*   `AttendanceHistoryDialog` history fetching is not implemented for web mode yet (TODO exists).
*   Hook interfaces for `useTimesheetEdit`, `useTimesheetCheckbox`, and others need to be updated to support nullable model instances.
*   Some pages (`cashAdvances.tsx`, `loans.tsx`, `leaves.tsx`, `shorts.tsx`) do not yet react to `DateSelector` changes; this is the next refactoring target.
*   Web mode data persistence for user-specific data (like selected company) across sessions needs to be robustly handled (currently relies on `authStore` initialization).
*   The overall data flow and state management for date-sensitive information across different pages needs to be streamlined (the planned custom hook should address this).

### PostCSS and Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Creating a custom `postcss.config.js` in the root or renderer directory can break Tailwind CSS processing
- Plugin naming conflicts between different versions can cause errors
- Multiple configuration files in both root and `renderer/` directories create conflicts

### Web/Nextron Layout Differences
- Centered content may appear "pulled up" in web mode compared to desktop
- This affects pages like the Payroll page's "Access Restricted" message
- Fix: Use `min-h-screen` on flex containers requiring vertical centering

### Desktop-Specific Code
- All code using `window.electron` API needs alternative implementations for web
- PDF generation relies on Node.js modules not available in browser
- File system operations need to be replaced with Firestore API calls

### Build Process
- Current web build process is functional but may need refinements
- Need to handle conditional imports for platform-specific code
- Webpack configuration may need adjustments for handling Node.js module fallbacks 

## UI Components Progress

### Enhanced EmployeeDropdown Component
We've implemented a significantly improved EmployeeDropdown component with the following features:
- Redesigned with a modern pill-shaped interface with a blue circle and white chevron arrow
- Self-contained employee data loading (no longer requires employees to be passed from parent)
- Works in both web and desktop modes using the appropriate data loading mechanism
- Displays random avatars for employees using the avatarUtils helper
- Uses React Portal to render the dropdown outside of any constraining containers
- Improved accessibility with keyboard navigation support
- Fixed positioning to ensure the dropdown is always visible
- Custom scrolling with thin scrollbar
- Loading state with spinner
- Automatic employee type display
- Responsive to window resizing and scrolling

The component now serves as a reusable, self-contained employee selector that can be used throughout the application without duplicating employee loading logic in each parent component.

### CashAdvances Module
- Successfully integrated the enhanced EmployeeDropdown component
- Simplified the parent component by removing employee loading logic
- Improved the UX with more consistent dropdown behavior

### Timesheet Components
- `timesheet_test.tsx` now correctly handles web mode
- `TimesheetService` supports both web and desktop modes
- Main timesheet interface (`timesheet.tsx`) needs interface updates to work properly in web mode (ongoing).
- Adapter functions needed for some component props to handle type compatibility.
