- ✅ Enhanced company selection UI with dedicated flow for authenticated users
- ✅ Critical bug fix for login dialog not appearing when company selection needed
- ✅ Electron app structure is in place (`main`, `renderer` processes).
- ✅ Next.js is used for the renderer process, allowing for React-based UI.
- ✅ Basic navigation and layout components (`Navbar`, `Sidebar`, `RootLayout`) are functional.
- ✅ SQLite is used as the local database via `better-sqlite3`.
- ✅ Dexie.js is implemented for client-side caching, initially for `AppSettings` and `Roles` in Firestore, and `Holidays`.

- ✅ Core models for Employee, Settings, Holiday, Cash Advance, Loan, Leave, Shorts, Role, Timesheet, Payroll, Statistics are defined.
- ✅ Firebase Authentication is integrated for web mode.
- ✅ Firestore is used as the backend for web mode, with models and services to interact with it (e.g., `settings_firestore.ts`, `role_firestore.ts`, `employee_firestore.ts`, `holiday_firestore.ts`, `statistics_firestore.ts`).
- ✅ Settings page (`settings.tsx`) allows viewing and some management of application settings, conditionally rendering for web/desktop.
- ✅ `RoleManagement.tsx` handles PIN authentication and role display, adapted for web mode.
- ✅ `ScheduleSettings.tsx` has been refactored to work in web mode.
- ✅ `CalendarDayCell.tsx` button styling is corrected.
- ✅ `StatisticsPage` (`statistics.tsx`) fetches data from Firestore in web mode and reacts to `DateSelector` changes.
- ✅ `HolidaysPage` (`holidays.tsx`) now correctly uses `useDateSelectorStore` to react to global date changes, fetching data from Firestore in web mode and local DB in desktop mode.
- ✅ `TimesheetService` is properly implemented to handle both web and desktop environments.
- ✅ `timesheet_test.tsx` correctly handles web mode by checking environment and using appropriate data sources.

- ✅ Enhanced CompensationDialog layout with improved spacing and visual consistency.
- ✅ Intelligent deduplication of CSS selectors to prevent duplicates in styleInjector.js.
- ✅ Fixed re-rendering issue in settings.tsx company name input field with local state and debounced store updates.
- ✅ Implemented shorts sync functionality for Firestore in both per-employee and bulk modes.
- ✅ Enhanced database management UI with employee selection for targeted shorts sync.
- ✅ Fixed linter error in ShortModel by adding getDbPath() method, following the same pattern as other models.
- ✅ Improved shorts sync UI to clarify that employee selection is optional, with clear messaging about which data will be synced.
- ✅ Enhanced useFirestoreSync hook to always include shorts in available models regardless of employee selection.
- ✅ Added better logging and progress reporting during shorts sync operations.

  - Improved hover contrast for clear buttons so they remain visible when hovered
  - Fixed dropdown select visibility issues with proper background contrast
  - Enhanced overall UI consistency across components
- ✅ Fixed select dropdown caret spacing and appearance in CompensationDialog
- ✅ Fixed DateRangePicker navigation buttons to properly change months with custom UI controls
- ✅ Fixed DateRangePicker console errors and implemented a more reliable navigation approach:
  - Replaced problematic ref-based approach with a complete UI reset (close/reopen) strategy
  - Used date-fns for more reliable date manipulation
  - Removed dependencies on the react-date-range internal API which was causing errors
  - Added proper date initialization on each calendar render
- Revamped `DateRangePicker` by switching to `react-multi-date-picker` library:
  - Addressed multiple styling issues with the new picker, including custom input, popover behavior, and contrast.
  - Fixed popover appearance and functionality (e.g., using `Calendar` component directly).

## What's Left to Build / Improve

1.  **Full Web Mode Compatibility for all Pages:**
    *   **Timesheet Component Interface Updates**: The current timesheet component has TypeScript interface issues when adapting for web mode. The hooks and components expect non-nullable model instances, but those models aren't available or needed in web mode. The component interfaces need to be updated to support a nullable or alternative pattern for web mode.
    *   **Adapt Timesheet-Related Components**: Several timesheet-related components like `AttendanceHistoryDialog`, `useTimesheetEdit`, `useTimesheetCheckbox`, and `useTimesheetHistoryOperations` need to be updated to support web mode with Firestore-backed data access.
    *   **Cache, Error Handling and Loading States**: Add proper caching, error handling, and loading states for web mode data fetching to improve the user experience during network latency.
    *   Ensure all pages that currently rely on local DB (`dbPath`) are fully functional in web mode using Firestore (`companyName`).
    *   This includes: `PayrollPage`, `TimesheetPage`, potentially others.
    *   **Create a custom React hook (e.g., `useDateAwareDataFetching`)** to encapsulate the common logic of subscribing to `useDateSelectorStore` and triggering data re-fetching when the selected date changes. Refactor `cashAdvances.tsx`, `loans.tsx`, `leaves.tsx`, and `shorts.tsx` to use this hook and remove redundant date management logic.
    *   **Implemented a modern, two-month calendar view in the DateRangePicker**:
      - Made the entire DateRangePicker clickable rather than just the individual date inputs
      - Fixed issues with z-index by using portal rendering directly to the document body
    *   **Fixed re-rendering issue with company name input field in settings.tsx by implementing a pattern that**:
      - Uses a local state variable for immediate typing feedback
      - Debounces updates to the global store
      - Only triggers store updates when typing has stopped for 500ms
      - Prevents the entire settings page from re-initializing on every keystroke
    *   **Implemented shorts sync functionality for Firestore in both per-employee and bulk modes**:
      - Added proper integration with useFirestoreSync.ts hook
      - Created bulk sync capability that processes all active employees' shorts
      - Added detailed progress reporting in the UI
      - Implemented robust error handling with per-employee isolation
    *   **DateRangePicker and Timesheet data display refinements**:
      - Custom CSS for `react-multi-date-picker` was removed, user preferred library defaults.
      - Input field in `DateRangePicker.tsx` now shows dates as "MMMM D, YYYY".
      - Timesheet data filtering in `timesheet.tsx` now adjusts `startDate` to be one day earlier to include the selected day's data.
2.  **Data Synchronization Strategy (Web & Desktop):**
    *   Define and implement a clear strategy for how data entered in web mode synchronizes with the local database if a user switches between modes (or vice-versa, though less common).
    *   Consider if two-way sync is needed or if one mode is primary.
3.  **Complete Firestore Models & Services:**
    *   Ensure all data models have corresponding Firestore save/load/update/delete functions (e.g., for `CashAdvance`, `Loan`, `Leave`, `Shorts`, `Payroll`, `Timesheet`).
4.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for models and services.
    *   Integration tests for UI components and data flow.
    *   End-to-end tests for key user workflows in both desktop and web mode.
5.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Consistent loading states and error handling across all pages.
    *   Improved visual feedback for user actions.
    *   Ensure all interactive elements are intuitive and accessible.
6.  **Offline Support for Web Mode (PWA features):**
    *   Investigate using service workers and caching to provide some level of offline functionality for the web version, if deemed necessary.
7.  **Data Migration & Backup (Desktop):**
    *   Ensure robust data migration for schema changes.
    *   Implement a user-friendly backup and restore mechanism for the local SQLite database.
8.  **Finalize Caching Strategy:**
    *   Review and extend Dexie.js caching to other relevant Firestore data (e.g., monthly schedules, payroll summaries) to improve performance and reduce Firestore reads.
9.  **Further CSS Synchronization Improvements:**
    *   Test the CSS synchronization script with additional components and styles.
    *   Add support for handling more complex CSS rules and selector patterns.
    *   Document the approach thoroughly and consider performance optimizations.

## Current Status

*   The application is partially functional in both desktop (JSON files as Database) and web (Firestore) modes.
*   Focus is on achieving full feature parity and stability for web mode, particularly data fetching and state management tied to global date selection.
*   Styling is now consistent between desktop and web modes through an automated CSS synchronization system.
*   The timesheet components work in the test environment, and styling issues have been fixed in the main interface.

## Known Issues

*   TypeScript errors in `renderer/pages/timesheet.tsx` when adapting for web mode - component interfaces expect non-nullable model instances that aren't available in web mode, or props are missing (`AttendanceHistoryDialog`).
*   `AttendanceHistoryDialog` history fetching is not implemented for web mode yet (TODO exists).
*   Hook interfaces for `useTimesheetEdit`, `useTimesheetCheckbox`, and others need to be updated to support nullable model instances.
*   Some pages (`cashAdvances.tsx`, `loans.tsx`, `leaves.tsx`, `shorts.tsx`) do not yet react to `DateSelector` changes; this is the next refactoring target.
*   Web mode data persistence for user-specific data (like selected company) across sessions needs to be robustly handled (currently relies on `authStore` initialization).
*   The overall data flow and state management for date-sensitive information across different pages needs to be streamlined (the planned custom hook should address this).

### CSS Synchronization
- The CSS synchronization script now properly handles copying styles from globals.css to styleInjector.js
- It includes intelligent deduplication of CSS selectors to prevent duplicates
- It skips Tailwind directives and other problematic selectors
- It's integrated into the web build and development process

### PostCSS and Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Creating a custom `postcss.config.js` in the root or renderer directory can break Tailwind CSS processing
- Plugin naming conflicts between different versions can cause errors
- Multiple configuration files in both root and `renderer/` directories create conflicts

### Web/Nextron Layout Differences
- Centered content may appear "pulled up" in web mode compared to desktop
- This affects pages like the Payroll page's "Access Restricted" message
- Fix: Use `min-h-screen` on flex containers requiring vertical centering

### Desktop-Specific Code
- All code using `window.electron` API needs alternative implementations for web
- PDF generation relies on Node.js modules not available in browser
- File system operations need to be replaced with Firestore API calls

### Build Process
- Current web build process is functional but may need refinements
- Need to handle conditional imports for platform-specific code
- Webpack configuration may need adjustments for handling Node.js module fallbacks 

## UI Components Progress

### Enhanced EmployeeDropdown Component
We've implemented a significantly improved EmployeeDropdown component with the following features:
- Redesigned with a modern pill-shaped interface with a blue circle and white chevron arrow
- Self-contained employee data loading (no longer requires employees to be passed from parent)
- Works in both web and desktop modes using the appropriate data loading mechanism
- Displays random avatars for employees using the avatarUtils helper
- Uses React Portal to render the dropdown outside of any constraining containers
- Improved accessibility with keyboard navigation support
- Fixed positioning to ensure the dropdown is always visible
- Custom scrolling with thin scrollbar
- Loading state with spinner
- Automatic employee type display
- Responsive to window resizing and scrolling

The component now serves as a reusable, self-contained employee selector that can be used throughout the application without duplicating employee loading logic in each parent component.

### CashAdvances Module
- Successfully integrated the enhanced EmployeeDropdown component
- Simplified the parent component by removing employee loading logic
- Improved the UX with more consistent dropdown behavior

### Timesheet Components
- `timesheet_test.tsx` now correctly handles web mode
- `TimesheetService` supports both web and desktop modes
- Main timesheet interface has fixed styling and infinite loop issues
- Consistent border styling between desktop and web modes
- CompensationDialog layout improved with better spacing
- Still needs interface updates to work properly in web mode (TypeScript compatibility) 

## 2023-05-15: Fixed Payroll Display in Web Mode

### Problem
The payroll display functionality wasn't working correctly in web mode. Specifically:
1. Date ranges weren't displaying properly, showing "Invalid Date - Invalid Date"
2. The filter buttons (Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Last Year) were not loading payrolls
3. The system was showing database path errors in web mode
4. Only the "Show All" button was working correctly to display payrolls

### Approach
We identified several key issues:
1. In web mode, the application was trying to use local file system paths (dbPath) which don't exist in web/Firestore mode
2. Dates from Firestore weren't being properly parsed and displayed
3. The filter buttons were relying on effects that weren't handling web mode correctly

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed database path handling in web mode:**
   - Added `effectiveDbPath` logic to use "web" as the path in web mode instead of trying to access the local file system
   - Updated all loading functions to use this approach consistently

2. **Fixed date parsing and display issues:**
   - Added comprehensive date parsing helpers to handle different date formats from Firestore
   - Created a robust `parseFirestoreDate` function to properly convert Firestore timestamps to JavaScript Date objects
   - Enhanced date comparison logic for filtering payrolls by date range

3. **Fixed filter button functionality:**
   - Made filter buttons directly load payrolls instead of relying on effects
   - Ensured proper date range expansion for better matches
   - Added debugging logs to identify any remaining issues

4. **Improved overall robustness:**
   - Enhanced error handling throughout the payroll loading process
   - Added fallbacks for date parsing to avoid "Invalid Date" displays
   - Prevented race conditions between various loading methods

### Outcome
The payroll display now works correctly in web mode:
1. Dates display properly in the correct format
2. All filter buttons (Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Last Year) work correctly
3. No more database path errors in web mode
4. Payrolls are correctly filtered and displayed according to the selected date range

### Files Modified
1. `renderer/pages/payroll.tsx` - Fixed database path handling for web mode
2. `renderer/components/PayrollList.tsx` - Fixed filter buttons and date display
3. `renderer/model/payroll_firestore.ts` - Added better date parsing for Firestore data

This fix ensures a consistent user experience between the desktop and web versions of the Sweldo application, allowing payroll records to be properly viewed and filtered in both environments.
