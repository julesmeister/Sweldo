## What Works
- ✅ Full desktop application functionality via Electron and local file system data storage.
- ✅ Core features: PDF generation, employee management, attendance tracking, compensation calculation.
- ✅ Modern React UI with Next.js, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Zustand.
- ✅ Web build process setup with Firebase hosting and Firestore integration for key modules (employees, payroll, holidays, settings, statistics, shorts).
- ✅ Login dialog, EmployeeList, HolidayCalendar, HolidaysPage, Settings page, RoleManagement, ScheduleSettings, StatisticsPage, timesheet_test.tsx adapted for web mode.
- ✅ Dexie.js caching implemented for key Firestore data (AppSettings, Roles, Holidays, EmployeeList, missingTime logs) with toast notifications.
- ✅ Authentication, session, and company name persistence in web mode via localStorage.
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS Fully Functional in Web Mode:** A dedicated build step (`npm run generate:tailwind` executing `renderer/scripts/generate-tailwind.js`) now correctly processes `renderer/styles/globals.css` with PostCSS/Tailwind. This generates a complete `tailwind-web.css` for web deployments, ensuring UI consistency with desktop. `styleInjector.js` links this file, and `sync-styles.js` injects only supplementary, non-directive-based critical styles.
- ✅ Automated CSS synchronization between globals.css and styleInjector.js for consistent styling, with intelligent deduplication.
- ✅ Robust DateRangePicker component using react-multi-date-picker with portal rendering and usability enhancements.
- ✅ `shorts.tsx` page fully functional in web mode (Firestore data, date reactivity).
- ✅ Various UI/UX enhancements and bug fixes (CompensationDialog, NoDataPlaceholder animation, etc.).

## What's Left to Build / Improve

1.  **Full Web Mode Compatibility for all Pages:**
    *   **Timesheet Component Interface Updates**: Address TypeScript interface issues for web mode (nullable models).
    *   **Adapt Timesheet-Related Components**: Update `AttendanceHistoryDialog`, `useTimesheetEdit`, `useTimesheetCheckbox`, `useTimesheetHistoryOperations` for web mode (Firestore data access).
    *   **Cache, Error Handling and Loading States**: Implement proper caching, error handling, and loading states for all web mode data fetching.
    *   Ensure remaining pages (e.g., `PayrollPage`, `TimesheetPage`) are fully functional in web mode using Firestore.
    *   **Create `useDateAwareDataFetching` hook**: Refactor `cashAdvances.tsx`, `loans.tsx`, `leaves.tsx` to use this hook for date reactivity.
2.  **Data Synchronization Strategy (Web & Desktop):**
    *   Define and implement a clear strategy for how data entered in web mode synchronizes with the local database if a user switches between modes (or vice-versa, though less common).
    *   Consider if two-way sync is needed or if one mode is primary.
3.  **Complete Firestore Models & Services:**
    *   Ensure all data models have corresponding Firestore save/load/update/delete functions (e.g., for `CashAdvance`, `Loan`, `Leave`, `Shorts`, `Payroll`, `Timesheet`).
4.  **Comprehensive Testing:**
    *   Unit tests for models and services.
    *   Integration tests for UI components and data flow.
    *   End-to-end tests for key user workflows in both desktop and web mode.
5.  **UI/UX Refinements:**
    *   Consistent loading states and error handling across all pages.
    *   Improved visual feedback for user actions.
    *   Ensure all interactive elements are intuitive and accessible.
6.  **Offline Support for Web Mode (PWA features):**
    *   Investigate using service workers and caching to provide some level of offline functionality for the web version, if deemed necessary.
7.  **Data Migration & Backup (Desktop):**
    *   Ensure robust data migration for schema changes.
    *   Implement a user-friendly backup and restore mechanism for the local SQLite database.
8.  **Finalize Caching Strategy:**
    *   Review and extend Dexie.js caching to other relevant Firestore data (e.g., monthly schedules, payroll summaries) to improve performance and reduce Firestore reads.
9.  **Further CSS Synchronization Improvements:**
    *   Test the CSS synchronization script with additional components and styles.
    *   Add support for handling more complex CSS rules and selector patterns.
    *   Document the approach thoroughly and consider performance optimizations.

## Current Status

*   The application is partially functional in both desktop (JSON files as Database) and web (Firestore) modes.
*   Focus is on achieving full feature parity and stability for web mode, particularly data fetching and state management tied to global date selection.
*   Styling is now consistent between desktop and web modes through an automated CSS synchronization system, primarily by ensuring Tailwind CSS is fully generated for web mode.
*   The timesheet components work in the test environment, and styling issues have been fixed in the main interface.

## Known Issues

*   TypeScript errors in `renderer/pages/timesheet.tsx` when adapting for web mode - component interfaces expect non-nullable model instances that aren't available in web mode, or props are missing (`AttendanceHistoryDialog`).
*   `AttendanceHistoryDialog` history fetching is not implemented for web mode yet (TODO exists).
*   Hook interfaces for `useTimesheetEdit`, `useTimesheetCheckbox`, and others need to be updated to support nullable model instances.
*   Some pages (`cashAdvances.tsx`, `loans.tsx`, `leaves.tsx`) do not yet react to `DateSelector` changes; this is the next refactoring target for `loans.tsx` and `leaves.tsx` using the planned custom hook.
*   Web mode data persistence for user-specific data (like selected company) across sessions needs to be robustly handled.
*   The overall data flow and state management for date-sensitive information across different pages needs to be streamlined.

### CSS Build & Configuration Notes
- **Primary Web Styling:** Web mode relies on `tailwind-web.css`, generated by `renderer/scripts/generate-tailwind.js` (via `npm run generate:tailwind`). This script processes `renderer/styles/globals.css` with PostCSS, Tailwind (using `renderer/tailwind.config.js`), and Autoprefixer.
- **Style Injection:** `renderer/utils/styleInjector.js` links the generated `tailwind-web.css` and injects other critical/supplementary styles.
- **`sync-styles.js` Role:** This script extracts specific, non-Tailwind-directive based CSS rules from `globals.css` for injection by `styleInjector.js`. Its role is supplementary to the main `tailwind-web.css`.
- **Configuration Sensitivity:** Care must be taken with PostCSS (`postcss.config.js` at project root) and Tailwind (`renderer/tailwind.config.js`) configurations to ensure they are correctly interpreted by the build process. Pathing for `content` in `tailwind.config.js` is relative to the config file itself.

### PostCSS and Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Creating a custom `postcss.config.js` in the root or renderer directory can break Tailwind CSS processing
- Plugin naming conflicts between different versions can cause errors
- Multiple configuration files in both root and `renderer/` directories create conflicts

### Web/Nextron Layout Differences
- Centered content may appear "pulled up" in web mode compared to desktop
- This affects pages like the Payroll page's "Access Restricted" message
- Fix: Use `min-h-screen` on flex containers requiring vertical centering

### Desktop-Specific Code
- All code using `window.electron` API needs alternative implementations for web
- PDF generation relies on Node.js modules not available in browser
- File system operations need to be replaced with Firestore API calls

### Build Process
- Current web build process (`npm run build:web`) now includes a crucial `npm run generate:tailwind` step to ensure correct CSS generation for web mode.
- Further refinements may involve ensuring `next build` correctly incorporates assets from `renderer/public` into the final `app` directory for Firebase, potentially simplifying the final asset copy step in `build:web`.
- Need to handle conditional imports for platform-specific code

### CSS Synchronization
- The CSS synchronization script now properly handles copying styles from globals.css to styleInjector.js
- It includes intelligent deduplication of CSS selectors to prevent duplicates
- It skips Tailwind directives and other problematic selectors
- It's integrated into the web build and development process

### PostCSS and Tailwind CSS Configuration
- Creating a custom `postcss.config.js` in the root or renderer directory can break Tailwind CSS processing
- Plugin naming conflicts between different versions can cause errors
- Multiple configuration files in both root and `renderer/` directories create conflicts

### Web/Nextron Layout Differences
- Centered content may appear "pulled up" in web mode compared to desktop
- This affects pages like the Payroll page's "Access Restricted" message
- Fix: Use `min-h-screen` on flex containers requiring vertical centering

### Desktop-Specific Code
- All code using `window.electron` API needs alternative implementations for web
- PDF generation relies on Node.js modules not available in browser
- File system operations need to be replaced with Firestore API calls

### Build Process
- Current web build process is functional but may need refinements
- Need to handle conditional imports for platform-specific code
- Webpack configuration may need adjustments for handling Node.js module fallbacks 

## Electron Production Build CSS Loading

**Status: FIXED**

The issue with CSS not loading properly in production builds (the compiled .exe) has been resolved with a multi-layered approach:

1. CSS files are now copied to multiple locations in the app package
2. CSS files are unpacked outside the asar archive
3. Direct CSS injection is used with multiple fallback paths
4. Event listeners verify which paths successfully load
5. Inlined styles provide a guaranteed fallback

This ensures the application maintains consistent styling between development and production builds.

## Window Maximization

**Status: IMPLEMENTED**

The application window now launches maximized with a smooth startup experience:

1. Window is created hidden initially
2. Window is maximized before showing
3. Window only becomes visible when fully loaded
4. No flickering or resizing after display
